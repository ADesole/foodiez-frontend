    steps:
      "Spray a small non-stick skillet with cooking spray. -Crack one egg on the counter, breaking it gently into a small prep dish. -Take care not to break the yolk. -Place prepared pan over medium heat on the stove and heat pan to very hot. -Gently slip egg into hot pan and immediately reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking for two minutes, or until egg white turns opaque and there is no clear egg white remaining. If necessary, cover pan for a minute to help cook the egg. -Remove pan from heat. Gently slip a spatula around the edges of the egg to make sure it is free of the pan, then tilt the pan and carefully slip the egg onto a waiting plate. Take care not to break the loose egg yolk. -Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.",
